# The-Gaming-Room-Design-Document
This is a project for my Operating platform course 

The gaming room is company with a game that was deployed only for the Android OS and is attempting to expand the game to other operating systems as well as make it web based.
They needs help with designing the new expansion with respect to their software requirements.  

I found that after completing the design document I thorghouly understood the requirments to the point I was able to successfully implement the reqireured bussiness
logic within the code. The UML description also allowed me to understand the achetechture of the classes so that I could correctly implement them. 
I think that the OS evaluation part could be improved. Most of it has surface level descriptions of the operating system specifics. In depth research into each 
OS would need to be done for a complete OS evaluation. The course mainly focused on operating systems in general and not the specifics of each one. 

When completing the design document I took into account the users needs by relizing that the users may not use the same OS when playing the game. It is imperative to 
anticipate what the users needs are and how they will use the software because the software will crash when it used in a way that it is not supposed to.
